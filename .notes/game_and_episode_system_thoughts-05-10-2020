I've been playing doom, blood, and quake a lot lately
I like the way levels and maps are things that are bundled

thinking placer will try to mimick this with some kind of dir and config file structure mimicking this kinda thing

game/
    assets/
        sprites/
        maps/
    ents/
        player.yaml // contains component lists
        zombie.yaml
        door.yaml
        ....
    eps/
        ep1/
            ep.yaml // contains orders of levels etc and points to them in some `levels` key
            level1.yaml // contains path to maps needed in tiled


this isn't necessary info right now though lol
more so i just need to get stuff on screen and start working on the destruction mechanic
